On a completely opposite note, these are all reasonable reactions as written because minds confronted with unexpected bad news will spit out stupid responses before the reality kicks in. So you might give a weirdly conversational response or a complete nonsequiter while you havent really understood and just know it's conventionally your turn to speak.

‘With Hamlet, the depth of his grief - and then the convergence of his grief into grievance - and how the compression of his grief; and the fact that his grief was somehow forbidden and curtailed is what turns that mourning - or that lack of mourning - into grievance. And it shows - I think - of all Shakespeare’s plays, the utility of retaliation and grievance. Hamlet has all this grievance: I must avenge my father; kill my uncle. And he’s angry with everybody, he can’t see the wood for the trees, and it only brings him ruin. But he was never allowed to let it go. To investigate that, and of course, Hamlet is about so much more than that. It’s about the value of being alive, and you have this young man who has lost his connection to the meaning of being alive. Having to inhabit that: what does it mean to feel that the argument for being has lost? That there is a question of the ‘be or not to be’; that maybe ‘not to be’ is a better idea… But he’s at that moment where he’s staring into the abyss, going: ‘Well, maybe it’s not so great, life actually.’ And to go down there, and investigate what that feels like, and give that shape. Of course, even in trying to explain the experience of playing these parts i’m somehow reducing it, or confining it. They live on.’  ~ Tom Hiddleston passionately talks about taking on the role of Hamlet
